<h2 id="写这么一大堆东西谁愿意看啊，我自己都不愿意看啊kora！"><a href="#写这么一大堆东西谁愿意看啊，我自己都不愿意看啊kora！" class="headerlink" title="写这么一大堆东西谁愿意看啊，我自己都不愿意看啊kora！"></a>写这么一大堆东西谁愿意看啊，我自己都不愿意看啊kora！</h2><p>Set in the background of <strong>American Civil War</strong> and the <strong>Reconstruction Era</strong>, the novel <strong>Gone with the Wind</strong>, shows the look of the society in Atlanta, Georgia during the time. It depicts the plantation-daughter, <strong>Scarlett O’Hara</strong>‘s twelve years of struggling life to survive and get out of her poverty.</p>
<p>The title “Gone with the Wind”, which was taken from a poem, appears in the monologue when Scarlett was on her way escaping from Atlanta to Tara, desperate to avoid the Yankees and flames of war.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Was Tara still standing? Or was Tara also gone with the wind which had swept through Georgia?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is no doubt that, it is the strong character Scarlett has that attributes to her uncommon life. Unless the war broke out, she might have remained the spoiled daughter of Gerald, with her thoughts completely on her beautiful appearance, her countless beaus and, Ashley Wilkes. However, to survive while the war was going on, she had to completely give up her elaborate manners. Sorrow, hunger, poverty had rebuilt her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Somewhere, on the long road that wound through those four years, the girl with her sachet and dancing slippers had slipped away and there was left a woman with sharp green eyes, who counted pennies and turned her hands to many menial tasks, a woman to whom nothing was left from the wreckage except the indestructible red earth on which she stood. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the story shows itself to us, Scarlett is trying her best to seek her true self. Through the changes of her relationships with other three main characters we can see that:</p>
<p>First, Ashley Wilkes. As a child, she couldn’t move her eyes out of him. She had tried her best to win Ashley’s affections, but all her efforts was paid in vain. It is his marriage to Melanie that made her furious and decided to marry poor Charles as a revenge. And, as time went by, her love for Ashley has gradually become her spirit support. After their conversation in Tara, she knew that Ashley and she come from different worlds, and thus have different opinions toward life. After the war, what she wanted to do was reviving the plantation, feeding the whole family and getting out of poverty. However, Ashley was always trying to get back at his good old days, dreaming for the past that has already “gone with the wind”. Ashley did love her, but it was only for her mind, her soul, and her nobility of character. Finally, after the death of Melly, she realized that all love she had for Ashley was just based on her imagination and no more than that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Life’s under no obligation to give us what we expect.<br>We take what we get and are thankful it’s no worse than it is.”</p>
<p>From Ashley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, Melanie. At first all the feelings Scarlett held for this lady is despisement and she was jealous of her marrying Ashley. But when Atlanta was under siege, Scarlett had to care for her and, as she thought, that was just because her promise to Ashley. But when they were in Tara, comradeship developed between them. Not only from fighting together against the Yankee-thief or putting out the fire together, but they treasured each other’s companion, at least Melly treasured and loved Scarlett. During the Reconstruction Era, Melly just tried her best to defend Scarlett’s reputation and always stood by her side. And, at last, Scarlett finally realized Melanie was one of her spirit support, but, it was too late.</p>
<p>At last, it is Rhett Butlet. Scoundrel as he is, he has always loved Scarlett, and always ready to lend a hand when she needed help. He tried his best to get Scarlett out of Atlanta during the siege, and he immediately went for her after he got out of the jail. And, he treasured little Bonnie as if she was the childlike little Scarlett. But after Bonnie’s death, he got upset and disappointed. On the other hand, Scarlett gradually saw through the mist in her heart and discovered her true love for Rhett in the end. But, but, it was too late, either.</p>
<p>At the end of the novel, Scarlett decided to get back to Tara, her plantation, to start her new life. Whether it’s because her Irish-blood or her life experience, she was fond of the red clay land, and she was fond of the farm. Just as she thinks, “she knows she could get Rhett back. There isn’t a man who she cannot get, once she has set her mind upon him.” And after all, tomorrow is another day.</p>
